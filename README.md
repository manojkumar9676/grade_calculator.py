# 🎓 Grade Calculator (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple **Grade Calculator** built using Python.  
It takes student marks as input, validates them, and assigns grades based on predefined **business rules** using decision-making statements.

This project is designed for **beginners and interns** to understand:
- Conditional logic
- Nested decision structures
- Real-world rule simulation
- Clean and readable code structure

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

## ⚙️ Features
- Accepts marks from the user
- Validates input range (0–100)
- Handles invalid and non-numeric inputs
- Uses `if-elif-else` and logical operators
- Implements nested conditions to simulate business rules
- Displays clear grade messages

## 📊 Grade Rules
| Marks Range | Grade | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 90 – 100 | A+ | Outstanding |
| 75 – 89 | A | Excellent |
| 60 – 74 | B | Good |
| 40 – 59 | C | Passed |
| 35 – 39 | D | Borderline Fail |
| Below 35 | F | Failed |
